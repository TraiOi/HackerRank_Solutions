# You are given N lines and your task is to find out which of the N lines starts with
# | hi<BLANK>
# where hi is case-insensitive and is not immediately followed by a space and a letter d(or D).
# In the above representation, BLANK denotes a space character.
# Input Format
# First line contains an integer N. N lines follow each line with a sentence not more than 10 words W each, separated by a single space.
# Constraints
# 1 <= N <= 10
# If C is the count of the number of words W in every sentence, then
# 1 <= C <= 10
# Each non-empty character in W is either a lowercase or an uppercase letter only
# Output Format
# Print each line that satisfies the constraint as mentioned in the problem statement.
# Sample Input
# | 5
# | Hi Alex how are you doing
# | hI dave how are you doing
# | Good by Alex
# | hidden agenda
# | Alex greeted Martha by saying Hi Martha
# Sample Output
# | Hi Alex how are you doing
# First line satisfies the constraint mentioned in the problem statement.
# Second line fails as it contains a d next to
# | hi<blank>
# Third line fails as it doesn't start with h
# Fourth line fails as the third character in the line is not empty ( BLANK )
# Fifth line fails as Hi Martha doesn't appear at the beginning of the line.
